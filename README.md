# Guideline-Aware AI Agent

A TypeScript-based AI agent that dynamically incorporates behavioral guidelines into its responses based on context and conversation state. The agent pulls guidelines from a Supabase database and constructs personalized system prompts to provide contextually appropriate sales interactions.

## ‚ú® NEW FEATURES

### üõçÔ∏è DummyJSON Products Integration
- **Live Product Data**: Integrated with DummyJSON API for real product information
- **Product Search**: Search across 100+ products in multiple categories
- **Categories**: Beauty, Electronics, Fashion, Home, and more

### üéØ Smart Suggestions
- **Context-Aware Recommendations**: AI suggests relevant products based on conversation

- description (text)
- content (text, not null) -- The actual guideline instruction
- priority (integer, 1-10) -- Higher priority guidelines take precedence
- category (text) -- e.g., 'objection_handling', 'demo_qualification'
- is_active (boolean)
- tags (text array) -- For categorization and filtering
- conditions (jsonb) -- Context conditions for when to apply this guideline
- created_at/updated_at (timestamps)
```

**Conversations Table:**
```sql
- id (UUID, primary key)
- messages (jsonb) -- Array of chat messages
- context (jsonb) -- Conversation context and applied guidelines
- created_at/updated_at (timestamps)
```

## üöÄ How to Deploy Locally

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** (v18+ recommended)
2. **Supabase account** and project
3. **OpenAI API key**

### Step 1: Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Guideline-Aware-AI-Agent
npm install
```

### Step 2: Environment Setup

1. Copy the environment template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Fill in your credentials in `.env`:
```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key
PORT=3001
```

**Getting Supabase Credentials:**
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a project
2. In your project dashboard, go to Settings ‚Üí API
3. Copy the Project URL and anon public key
4. For the service role key, copy it from the same API settings page

**Getting OpenAI API Key:**
1. Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Create an account and navigate to API Keys
3. Create a new secret key

### Step 3: Database Setup

Run the database setup script to create tables and insert sample guidelines:

```bash
npm run setup
```

This will:
- Create the necessary database tables
- Insert 5 sample guidelines covering common sales scenarios
- Verify the database connection

### Step 4: Start the Application

For development with hot reload:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts both the API server (port 3001) and the web client (port 3000).

For production build:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Step 5: Test the Application

1. **Open the web interface**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Check the API documentation**: http://localhost:3001
3. **Verify health**: http://localhost:3001/health

## üß™ Testing the Agent

### Sample Conversations

Try these messages to see different guidelines in action:

1. **Pricing Objection**: "This seems too expensive for our budget"
   - Should trigger the "Handle Pricing Objections" guideline
   - Response will focus on value proposition and ROI

2. **Demo Request**: "Can I see a demo of your product?"
   - Triggers "Demo Request Protocol" guideline
   - Agent will qualify before scheduling

3. **Feature Comparison**: "How does this compare to [competitor]?"
   - Applies "Feature Comparison Strategy" guideline
   - Focuses on business outcomes over features

4. **Security Concerns**: "What about data security and compliance?"
   - Triggers "Security Concerns Response" guideline
   - Highlights certifications and enterprise security

### API Testing

You can also test the API directly:

**Create a guideline:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/guidelines \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Follow-up Strategy",
    "content": "Always schedule a specific follow-up time before ending the conversation.",
    "priority": 7,
    "category": "closing",
    "tags": ["follow-up", "closing"]
  }'
```

**Send a chat message:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/chat/message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "I need to think about it",
    "context": {
      "user_intent": "objection_handling",
      "keywords": ["think", "consider"]
    }
  }'
```

## üß™ Testing the New Features

### Test Smart Suggestions

```bash
# 1. Start the servers
npm run dev

# 2. Visit http://localhost:3000 for the web interface

# 3. Try these example messages:
- "I need a smartphone for photography"
- "Looking for beauty products" 
- "Compare laptops for work"
- "What are your most affordable products?"

# 4. Watch for Smart Suggestions panel on the left showing:
- Product recommendations
- Confidence scores (0-100%)
- Reasons for suggestions
- Interactive product cards
```

### Test Product API Directly

```bash
# Search for products
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/products/search?q=smartphone&limit=3"

# Get specific product
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/products/1"

# Get all categories
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/products/categories/list"

# Test chat with suggestions
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/api/chat/message" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "I need a smartphone for photography"}'
```

## üìã Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. **Dynamic Guideline Selection**
- Guidelines are selected based on conversation context
- Multiple conditions can trigger guideline application
- Priority system ensures most important guidelines take precedence

### 2. **Context Awareness**
- User intent classification (pricing, demo request, etc.)
- Conversation stage tracking (introduction ‚Üí discovery ‚Üí closing)
- Keyword extraction for content-based guideline matching

### 3. **Intelligent Prompt Construction**
- System prompts are built dynamically for each message
- Guidelines are formatted with priorities and categories
- Context information is included for better responses

### 4. **Conversation Management**
- Full conversation history is maintained
- Applied guidelines are tracked per conversation
- Context evolves as the conversation progresses

## üîß Architectural Decisions

### Why This Stack?

1. **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and better developer experience
2. **Supabase**: Managed PostgreSQL with real-time features and easy setup
3. **Express.js**: Minimal, flexible web framework for rapid prototyping
4. **OpenAI GPT-4**: Reliable, high-quality AI responses with good instruction following
5. **Vanilla Frontend**: Keeps the demo simple and focused on the core functionality

### Design Patterns

1. **Service Layer Architecture**: Clear separation between data access, business logic, and presentation
2. **Context-Driven Guidelines**: Guidelines are applied based on conversation state rather than rigid rules
3. **Priority-Based Selection**: Multiple guidelines can apply, but higher priority ones take precedence
4. **Stateful Conversations**: Full conversation context is maintained for better continuity

### Scalability Considerations

- **Database**: PostgreSQL JSON fields provide flexibility for evolving guideline conditions
- **Caching**: Guidelines could be cached in Redis for high-traffic scenarios
- **Rate Limiting**: OpenAI API calls should be rate-limited in production
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth could be added for multi-tenant use

## üéØ Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced NLP**: Better intent classification and entity extraction
2. **A/B Testing**: Test different guideline sets for effectiveness
3. **Analytics Dashboard**: Track guideline performance and conversation outcomes
4. **Integration APIs**: Connect with CRM systems and sales tools
5. **Voice Interface**: Add speech-to-text for voice-based interactions
6. **Multi-language Support**: Localized guidelines for international sales teams
